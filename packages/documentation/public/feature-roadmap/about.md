Curious to know what features you can help us develop?

You will see on our roadmap that there are a lot of opportunities to expand the functionalities of the platform, both the functionality of the course cards as well as navigation on the platform for example.
We continuously update our product roadmap with new features.

We are also open to discuss features you would like to work on that are not on our roadmap. You can get in touch via [email](mailto:contact@offcourse.io) to discuss the possibilities.
